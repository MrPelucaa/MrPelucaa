# Hi, my name is Diego, aka MrPeluca

## What am I?
- Currently studying what we call over here **Civil Engineering in IT**. Thats almost a raw translation of my degree (Ingeniería Civil en Informática). 
- I really like developing fun stuff in my free time, currently trying to specialize in cybersecurity.
- I kinda got very little experience in a lot of stuff so I dont know what to write here, I just didnt like the default readme.md

## Where you can find me

## What I love
- Anything open source <3
